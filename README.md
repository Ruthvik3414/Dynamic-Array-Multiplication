# Dynamic-Array-Multiplication
This C++ program showcases dynamic memory allocation and pointer use. It multiplies every element of a C-style array with every element of a second array, storing the results in a new dynamic array. The code highlights key concepts like new and delete[] for memory management, and passing arrays to functions via pointers.
